Changes from v0.5.0 to v1.0.0, August 2024
------------------------------------------

* Initial port to Python 3.12


Changes from v0.2.0 to v0.5.0, July 2013
----------------------------------------

* Theme support

Changes from v0.2.0 to v0.3.0, June 2005
----------------------------------------

Changes from v0.1.0 to v.0.2.0, May 2005
----------------------------------------

* Added mouse support. You can now play against GNU Go by clicking the left mousebutton
* Added support for guessing your way through a SGF using the right mousebutton
* Added support for going to the next step in an SGF with the middle mousebutton
* Implemented my own SGF-reading rutine, since I was not satisfied with the way GNU Go handled them. GNU Go was unable to handle a couple of files I have that missed the SZ[19] setting in the header. Loading SGF-files with GNU Go, and then importing the moves via move_history turned out to be a buggy solution, since the coordinates I got out was completely strange. It works nicely for me now.
