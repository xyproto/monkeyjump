# Plans

## Packaging

- [ ] Add a man page

## User experience

- [ ] Graphical effects and sound, like in Tetris, when stones disappear
- [ ] A command for showing all the suggested next moves from GNU Go
- [ ] Better placement of the letters and numbers
- [ ] Nicer rendering, perhaps with: https://github.com/popojan/goban
- [ ] A menu at the top

## SGF-support

- [ ] Bugfix the SGF-reader
- [ ] Support for branching in SGF-files
- [ ] Better support of comments in SGF-files

## Gameplay

- [ ] A handicap-command that takes a number from 1 to 9
- [ ] Automatically show the final score when the game is finished

## Maybe

- [ ] Make it possible to use transparent images for the stones

## Experimental

- [ ] XMLRPC-support, just to see if it will be useful
- [ ] Understand when a group is out of liberties, without the help of GNU Go

## Completed

- [x] Add desktop shortcut and icon for the Arch Linux package
- [x] Port to Python 3
